# Weather app
This weather app gives to you the temperature and weather condition from your current location.

## Why I did this?
I did this because ... this was a freecodecamp project, So when I started doing it, I have fun. Since my last project upload 
on github, I learned how use APIs. And I remember when I used APIs was a headache. But right now I love APIs <3.

## How I did this?
In this project I used Jquery, Bootstrap, Font awesome and The APIs are [Openweathermap api](https://openweathermap.org/api)
and the [HTML5 Geolocation api](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp). If you want see the APIs, please click
the links.
